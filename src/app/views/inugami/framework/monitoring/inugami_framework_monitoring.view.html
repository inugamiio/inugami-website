                           Monitoring is a vital aspect of an application that should be considered from the design phase.
                           Retrofitting it into an existing system is a significant challenge.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Achieving granular application monitoring is a major challenge. Experience in extreme
                           operational environments shows that attempting to build such a solution without a dedicated
                           framework often leads to prohibitive technical debt.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Inugami was born from the need to supervise a massive mobile application, utilizing multiple
                            datacenters for its backend, all while maintaining an operational quality that allowed no
                            more than 5 minutes of annual downtime. The insights gained from these extreme constraints
                            led to the comprehensive suite of monitoring tools now integrated into Inugami.

                        <p>
                            A properly monitored application must provide real-time, precise insight into exactly what 
                            it is doing and whether its behavior is normal. Logs are the richest source of information 
                            an application can produce. They should not be viewed as an infrastructure cost, but as a
                            goldmine of information—not only for technical health but, more importantly,
                            for business intelligence.

                                   The real question we must ask ourselves is:
                                    how much will an application failure <strong>cost</strong> us—both in terms of <strong>reputation and financial impact</strong>?

                               Inugami’s <a routerLink="/inugami/framework/exception">exception management documentation</a> highlights the framework’s extensive use of
                               the MDC (<strong>Mapped Diagnostic Context</strong>) to track errors. This management goes far beyond simple
                               logging. it is the very heart of Inugami’s monitoring strategy.

                                To unlock the full potential of logs, a tool capable of consuming a high-speed JSON
                                stream is essential. While several options exist, such as ElasticSearch/Kibana, Datadog or Splunk.

                                        is Elasticsearch coupled with Kibana.

                                    To demonstrate Inugami’s monitoring capabilities, the choice was made to integrate
                                    it with Elasticsearch and Kibana for this demo. The concepts discussed are generic
                                    and can be transposed to other tools. Only the creation and usage of information
                                    within the observation tool will differ.

                                The objective of this demo is to demonstrate how to set up a relatively comprehensive
                                dashboard, all in a very simple manner. The dashboard in question is as follows:
                            </p>
                            <figure>
